## Food for Thought

From [The Dilemma of Naming Fontsize variables](https://css-tricks.com/the-dilemma-of-naming-font-size-variables/)
> What we need is a scale syntax that allows room for changes. Adding a new size to the scale should be easy without introducing breaking changes. I’m thinking of a kind of scale that is both **flexible** and **infinite**. It must be more sophisticated than $small, $medium and $large.

> It should be also be descriptive and intuitive. Preferably, you shouldn’t have to look up the variable names in the settings file or the config, or wherever you store these things. I don’t have the slightest clue if $epsilon comes before or after $sigma. Do you?

Another way would be to borrow from the way font-weight is set with numbers like 400 for **regular**. Taking this idea and applying it to font sizes would then look like:

```css
--size-font-100: 12px;
--size-font-400: 16px;
--size-font-500: 20px;
--size-font-600: 21px;
```
