## What are Organisms?

Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

Let’s revisit our search form molecule. A search form can often be found in the header of many web experiences, so let’s put that search form molecule into the context of a header organism.

The header forms a standalone section of an interface, even though it contains several smaller pieces of interface with their own unique properties and functionality.

Organisms can consist of similar or different molecule types. A header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary navigation list, and search form. We see these types of organisms on almost every website we visit.
