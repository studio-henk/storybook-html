An effective icon is a graphic asset that expresses a single concept in ways people instantly understand.

## Icons at HENK
At HENK we use SVG icons, designed in Figma and copied / exported as SVG files / code. In Twig we use them as code in order to have more control over its styling and animation possibilities.

### Note !
Please make sure in Figma that icons have widths and heights of full pixels, so no width of 17.13 etc. That might cause alignment issues.
