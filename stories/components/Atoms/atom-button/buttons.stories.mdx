In general, a button combines three attributes to clearly communicate its function:

- Style. A visual style based on size, color, and shape.
- Content. The symbol (or interface icon), text label, or both that a button displays to convey its purpose.
- Role. A system-defined role that identifies a button’s semantic meaning and can affect its appearance.

## Style
You can configure a system button to use any combination of style and size.

### size
- regular
- small
- xsmall

### style
- plain
- filled?
- accented?

## Content
- label
- icon

## Role
A system button can have one of the following roles:

- Normal. No specific meaning.
- Primary. The button is the default button — the button people are most likely to choose.
- Cancel. The button cancels the current action.
- Destructive. The button performs an action that can result in data destruction.
A button’s role can have additional effects on the appearance you configure. For example, the system uses bold text for the label in a primary button, whereas a destructive button uses a red color.

Assign the primary role to the button people are most likely to choose. When a primary button responds to the Return key, it makes it easy for people to quickly confirm their choice. In addition, when the button is in a temporary view — like a sheet, an editable view, or an alert — assigning it the primary role means that the view can automatically close when people press Return.

Don’t assign the primary role to a button that performs a destructive action, even if that action is the most likely choice. Because of its visual prominence, people sometimes choose a primary button without reading it first. Help people avoid losing content by assigning the primary role to nondestructive buttons.
