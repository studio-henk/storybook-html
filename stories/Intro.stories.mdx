# Welcome to HENK's Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easier to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## todo
- organize folders and docs: https://storybook.js.org/blog/structuring-your-storybook/
- find out how to have doc page before component story
- find out how to use a component on a doc page like this one
- find out how to use a story of a component on a doc page like this one

## results
- figma plugin: need paid account to be able to show storybook component inside figma (shared library limit)
- figma design addon: show figma design in storybook. stopped working. maybe rights issue?
